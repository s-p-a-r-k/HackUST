Solving Traffic Congestion in Hong Kong

Given Uber's shared data, we deduced that the Surge Multiplier that Uber uses to determine 
price of a ride is directed correlated with congestion of traffic in the area. So our idea was to 
locate various surge zones and identify these areas to the user. Give the user the capability to check the time
of day and week of day on where high surge areas are. If the user is in a highly surged area, we will advise a path for the
user to move out of the surge area to take taxi or Uber. This way the user can direct the taxi drivers and uber out of the traffic
congested area, helping diverge the overload of vehicles.

Current Features:
The app loads with our customly designed UI screens and images. Animation to show loading which is currently preset with a count
down timer. The next screen will check whether or not location services is turned on and will redirect the user to the settings to turn it on.
Our main screen has google maps and the ability to choose a week of day and time. Currently only the week of day function works and this will 
display every surge region in that day.

Future Features:
Carpooling, but this is a sensitive topic since carpooling legalality in Hong Kong is special.
Importing of more data to get more accurate surge regions, currently is just used fixed data
